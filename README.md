## Introduction
In modern healthcare, data-driven decision-making plays a crucial role in improving patient care and hospital efficiency. This Power BI project focuses on analyzing hospital emergency patient data to gain insights into patient demographics, visit patterns,  Patient Admission Status, Patient Age Distribution, Department Referrals, Timeliness, Gender Analysis, Racial Demographics, Time Analysis.
By leveraging Power BIâ€™s powerful visualization tools, this project aims to identify trends, peak emergency hours, and patient flow bottlenecks, ultimately assisting hospital administrators and medical professionals in optimizing emergency department operations.
Through interactive dashboards, stakeholders can monitor key performance indicators (KPIs), predict patient inflow, and enhance response times. The insights derived from this analysis can lead to improved patient care, better allocation of medical resources, and overall efficiency in emergency healthcare services.

## Descriptive Analysis

(April 2023 - October 2024)


- The emergency room dataset, covering a period of 19 months, records a total of 9,216 unique patients.







- Patient Wait Time & Satisfaction:

The Average wait time was approximately 35.3 minutes, indicating a need for improvement to enhance patient flow. The average satisfaction score was 4.99 out of 10,

suggesting moderate satisfaction and highlighting areas for improving patient experiences.





- Departmental Referrals:

A significant number of Patients (5400) did not required referrals. Among those referred, the most common were General Practice (1840 cases) and Orthopedics (995 Cases),

followed by Physiotherapy (276 Cases) and Cardiology (248 Cases)





- Peak busy Periods:

The busiest day were Saturday (1377 Patients), Saturdays (1322 Patients), and Tuesdays (1318 Patients). The busiest hours were 11 AM, 7 PM, 01 PM, and 11 PM indicating

need of ample staffing during these periods.



- Patient Demographics:

Age Groups: Adults (30- 39 Years) formed a large group (1200 Patients), followed by young adults (20 - 29 Years) with 1188 Patients. Other significant groups included middle

aged as well (40 - 50 Years).





- Race Distribution:

The largest racial group was White (2571), followed by African American (1951), multi racial (1557), and Asian (1060) patients. A significant number of patients (1030) declined

to identify their race.





- Admission Patterns:

Nearly half of the patients (4612) were admitted, while the rest (4604) were treated and released.





- Summary:

The dataset reveals high patient volumes, moderate satisfaction levels, and common referrals to General Practice and Orthopedics. Mondays and late night to early mornings

hours are particularly busy. The patient demographics show a diverse age and racial composition, with nearly equal numbers of admitted and non admitted patients. These

insights can help optimize resource allocation and improve patient care in the emergency room.
